<b>Towelie</b> is a static analysis tool which can help you keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), but letting you know where you have repeat text in your code. Run towelie on a directory specifying a glob, and towelie will generate a report for you, or let you know that you amazingly have no repeat code. Towelie is language agnostic, and is used to analyze text, not code necessarily.
