<b>Towelie</b> is a static analysis tool which can help you keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) by letting you know where you have copy and pasted entire files or portions of them. Run towelie on a directory, and towelie will magically generate a report for you indicating what has been repeated and in which files. Towelie is language agnostic and can be used on any text document.
